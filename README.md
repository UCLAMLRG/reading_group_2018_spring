# UCLA Machine Learning Reading Group - Spring 2018

**Goals**: This quarter, we will emphasize hands-on applications of machine learning. To do this, we will be working on some short projects together with the goal of studying a science case in detail and hopefully to extend the analyses in scientifically interesting ways and potentially work on a paper.

**Organizers**: Tuan Do ([@followthesheep](https://github.com/followthesheep)), Bernie Boscoe ([@bboscoe](https://github.com/bboscoe))

## Papers

We will based our projects on the following papers:

- Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning: A Five-planet Resonant Chain around Kepler-80 and an Eighth Planet around Kepler-90, Shallue et al. (2018)
  - [Paper Link](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155...94S)
  - [J. Zink's discussion of this paper in Winter 2018](https://github.com/UCLAMLRG/reading_group_2018_winter/blob/master/week6/mlKepler.pdf)
  - Code from paper: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/astronet

- Generative adversarial networks recover features in astrophysical images of galaxies beyond the deconvolution limit, Schawinski et al. (2017)
  - http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.467L.110S
  - arxiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00403
  - [Discussion in Winter 2018](https://github.com/UCLAMLRG/reading_group_2018_winter/tree/master/week2)
