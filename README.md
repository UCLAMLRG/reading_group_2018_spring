# UCLA Machine Learning Reading Group - Spring 2018

**Goals**: This quarter, we will emphasize hands-on applications of machine learning. To do this, we will be working on some short projects together with the goal of studying a science case in detail and hopefully to extend the analyses in scientifically interesting ways and potentially work on a paper.

**Organizers**: Tuan Do ([@followthesheep](https://github.com/followthesheep)), Bernie Boscoe ([@brandles](https://github.com/brandles))

## Papers

We will based our projects on the following papers:

- Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning: A Five-planet Resonant Chain around Kepler-80 and an Eighth Planet around Kepler-90, Shallue et al. (2018)
