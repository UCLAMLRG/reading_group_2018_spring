# Week 3 SciServer Intro and TensorFlow Tutorial

## Quick-Getting started with SciServer Compute

1. Login to alpha02.sciserver.org with your account and go to Compute
2. Create a new container (Docker container), choose the type to be Python, and a container Jupyter notebook interface will be created.
3. On the right hand side, go to New-> terminal and a black terminal interface will appear.

6. the repository will now be in your persistent folder.
7. Navigate to week3 and open the TensorFlow jupyter notebook for the tutorial or create your own new notebook. 

**NOTE**: Only data stored in `persistent` will be saved!
